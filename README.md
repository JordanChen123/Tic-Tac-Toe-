# Tic-Tac-Toe-
Classic Tic Tac Toe Game

Tic Tac Toe was the first mini project that I wanted to do initially as creating a Tic Tac Toe game was my first ever coding project assigned to me in my grade 10 computer programming class, but instead of using C, in grade 10 we were using Python. I remember struggling a lot in creating the tic tac toe game using python, mainly because my overall coding knowledge was very minimal and underdeveloped. After having gone through APSC 160, I decided to put my new knowledge into practice by retackling the Tic Tac Toe game by developing the entire game from C.
